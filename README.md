This repository contains my enhanced CS 499 Capstone project.
It is based on the Animal Shelter Dashboard originally developed in CS 340 and enhanced to improve Software Design, Algorithms & Data Structures, and Database Integration. All enhancements were applied to the same set of original project files, adapted to meet the specific goals of each category.
