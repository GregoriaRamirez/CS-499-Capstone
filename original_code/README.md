\# Original Code â€“ CS 340 Animal Shelter Project



This folder contains the original version of my Animal Shelter Dashboard project, developed in CS 340. This version was created using Jupyter Notebook and includes the original implementation of the `AnimalShelter` class with basic CRUD operations and hardcoded credentials.



The enhanced version, used for my CS 499 Capstone, improves on this by:

\- Modularizing the code

\- Replacing hardcoded credentials with environment variables

\- Adding new filters (breed, color)

\- Implementing secure MongoDB handling and input validation
