# Original Code â€“ CS 340 Animal Shelter Project

This folder contains the original version of my Animal Shelter Dashboard project, created in CS 340: Client-Server Development.  
This version represents the starting point before enhancements were made for the CS 499 Capstone project.


The original code was developed in Jupyter Notebook and includes:
- A basic `AnimalShelter` class with CRUD operations  
- Hardcoded MongoDB connection credentials  
- Early dashboard features such as a searchable data table and simple charts
