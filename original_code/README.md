- Implemented in **Jupyter Notebook** with Python, Dash, and MongoDB  
- Basic `AnimalShelter` class with CRUD operations  
- **Hardcoded MongoDB credentials** for database access  
- Early dashboard features: a searchable data table and simple charts  

## ðŸ“„ Files in This Folder

- Supporting files from the CS 340 course deliverables
