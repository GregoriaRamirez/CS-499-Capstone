# ðŸ§ª Code Review â€“ CS 499 Capstone

This folder contains the Code Review materials for my CS 499 Computer Science Capstone Project.

## ðŸ“„ Contents
- `CodeReviewScript.md` â€“ The full script used to record my code review walkthrough.
- `CodeReviewVideoTranscript.docx` â€“ Transcript of the narrated walkthrough video.
- `CodeReview_Enhancement_Notes.docx` â€“ Notes outlining the enhancements categorized under:
  - Software Design & Engineering
  - Algorithms & Data Structures
  - Databases

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The code review demonstrates how my original project from CS 340 was enhanced to meet the learning outcomes of the Computer Science program. In the video, I explain my original codebase, identify weaknesses, and walk through how I applied enhancements to improve structure, performance, and security.

This review aligns with the ePortfolio requirements and supports my reflections in the Software Design, Algorithms, and Database artifact pages.
