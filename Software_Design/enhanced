This folder contains the enhanced version of the Software Design artifact.
Changes include modularized code structure, separation of UI (view.py) from backend logic (controller.py, model.py), removal of hardcoded credentials, and the use of __init__.py to organize the application into packages.
requirements.txt and .env_example are included for portability and environment setup.
