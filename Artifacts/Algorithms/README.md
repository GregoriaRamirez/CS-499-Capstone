# Algorithms & Data Structures â€” Original Artifact

## Description
The original dashboard filtering logic was written in a repetitive, inefficient way inside the main application file. Filtering operations were manually repeated for each user selection.

## Limitations
- Repeated code for each filter (breed, color, outcome type).
- Inefficient row-by-row filtering instead of optimized operations.
- Filtering logic and UI callbacks tightly coupled.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Dash
- Pandas
