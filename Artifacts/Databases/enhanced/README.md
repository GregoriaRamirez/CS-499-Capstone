# Databases â€” Enhanced Artifact

## Description
The enhanced version secures the database connection, adds logging, and ensures proper error handling for a more professional backend integration.

## Key Enhancements
- **Secure Connection:** Credentials stored in `.env` file and loaded using `python-dotenv`.
- **Error Handling:** Try/except blocks to prevent crashes if the database is unreachable.
- **Logging:** Structured logging for database operations.
- **Connection Cleanup:** Ensures MongoDB client is closed after operations.
- **Data Cleaning:** Converts MongoDB output to a Pandas DataFrame and removes the `_id` field.

## Benefits
The project now follows professional security practices and is more reliable for production use.
