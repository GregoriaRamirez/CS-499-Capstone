# Software Design & Engineering — Original Artifact

## Description
This is the original version of my Animal Shelter Dashboard project, created for CS 340: Client-Server Development. The project was developed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, Dash, and MongoDB.

## Key Features
- Built using Jupyter Notebook with direct database connection.
- Contained hardcoded database credentials in the code.
- CRUD operations for interacting with the MongoDB collection.
- Single-file design, with UI and backend logic combined.

## Limitations in Original
- Credentials stored in plain text within the code.
- No modular code structure — all logic and UI in one file.
- No logging or error handling for failed operations.
- Limited reusability and maintainability.
