# Software Design & Engineering â€” Enhanced Artifact

## Description

This enhanced artifact contains the updated Animal Shelter Dashboard code, refactored for improved modularity and maintainability. The same enhanced code files are used here, but this README focuses on the **Software Design** improvements.

The Animal Shelter Dashboard, completed for my CS 499 Capstone, was restructured to follow a modular MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Backend logic, user interface, and database operations are separated into dedicated files, improving readability, scalability, and maintainability.


## Key Enhancements
- **Modular Design:** Separated `model.py`, `view.py`, and `controller.py` for maintainability.
- **Secure Credentials:** Moved database credentials to `.env` file.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Added `requirements.txt` for dependency tracking.
- **Logging:** Added `logging` for debugging and tracking database operations.

## Benefits
The enhanced version is more professional, maintainable, and ready for real-world deployment.
