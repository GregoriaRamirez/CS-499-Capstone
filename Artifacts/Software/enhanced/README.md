# Software Design & Engineering â€” Enhanced Artifact

## Description
This is the enhanced version of my Animal Shelter Dashboard project, completed for my CS 499 Capstone. The code was refactored to follow a modular MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure, with separated files for backend logic, UI, and database operations.

## Key Enhancements
- **Modular Design:** Separated `model.py`, `view.py`, and `controller.py` for maintainability.
- **Secure Credentials:** Moved database credentials to `.env` file.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Added `requirements.txt` for dependency tracking.
- **Logging:** Added `logging` for debugging and tracking database operations.

## Benefits
The enhanced version is more professional, maintainable, and ready for real-world deployment.
